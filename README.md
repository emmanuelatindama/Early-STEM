# Early-STEM

This project is to compare student by demographics and test scores to determine whether the interventions implemented by the college in previous years were effective in increasing student perfomance (measured using graduation rates).
Next, our goal is to determine which factors are fundamental in predicting the success rate of a student, so that the college can put in place measures to help weaker (students at higher risk of not graduating).
